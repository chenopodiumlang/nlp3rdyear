1;What an outstanding movie. I love the way that they've developed all the characters. Also we they made the closeness of the family come out. It is a coming-of-age movie where the family, close as children, grow up, get married, and drift off into their own lives.
1;Another remake of Little Women--and this one is spectacular. Instead of telling the story in a linear fashion, Gerwig begins in the present and then flashes back and flashes forward and back again, etc., unpeeling layers of meaning and emotion in the process. The cast is superb--Saoirse Ronan is dazzling as is the camera work and musical score. Why would Gerwig choose to present the narrative complexly rather than in a straightforward manner? The latter approach has already been done ad nauseum, for one. Secondly, Gerwig has made Jo into Alcott's alter ego, and as Jo struggles to get published in New York, she reminisces about her adolescence and early adulthood in the March family. When one thinks, there are no time constraints--you can be anywhere, anytime you want and jump freely as your thoughts inspire you. As the audience for the film witnesses this random sequencing, we experience new anticipations, meanings, and insights not possible in a linear presentation. If the movie frustrated you, I urge you to watch it again with these ideas in mind at a bargain theater or certainly on cable--the experience will be rewarding
1;Incredible writing, performances, cinematography, and score. Felt like I was living in the world with all of the characters. Saoirse Ronan deserves to win Best Actress.
1;This was definitely my favorite movie of the year. Even though the expectations were high and this story has been told so many times this version was so unique and powerful in comparison. Greta Gerwig did a phenomenal job along with the amazing cast. Saoirse Ronan as Jo March was destiny and Florence Pugh as Amy March was a real scene stealer. The acting performances and the directing truly make this movie Oscar worthy.
1;The best movie, the best screenplay،In one opinion, we can say that it is a complete, unique film.
1;simply one of the best films of all time, a classic, masterpiece of what we call cinematography.
1;This is an absolute masterpiece and one of the best movies ever made. Excellent performances, soundtrack, cinematography and in everything else across the board.
1;An absolute masterpiece from its first frame tell the last. Coppola brought nuance and humanity to this world, while also bringing melancholy and grandiosity to the style.
1;Not having read the novels, I have to say that the "Godfather" tells the story incredibly well. It is indeed long, but so well performed, that the slow paste doesn't really affect it. Moreover, the acting is at its finest.
1;This is what movies should strive to be. Every scene, every frame oozing with perfection. Marlon Brandon gives his best ever performance and really sets up a trilogy. Im glad this was made thank you Coppola
1;The Godfather, to me, is the greatest film of all time. It's a masterpiece, it is nothing short of perfection, I don't have a single bad thing to say about it.
1;This is such a mesmerizing movie with such greatness in everything like the performamces, the cinematography and the direction.
1;Absolutely, positively the greatest movie ever made. Every frame is perfection from start to finish. It will never be bettered. There is nothing more to add.
1;The best film I have ever seen. May get a fair amount of criticism nowadays but to think that this film was made 40 years ago, that's pretty incredible!
1;Amazing! One of the best romance movies I've seen. The acting is spot on, Spike Jonze direction and script are incredible. As of right now my favourite movie of 2013.
1;A beautiful movie with sincere and relaxing moments, extraordinary performances, a undeniably powerful script, amazing soundtrack and a spectacular Spike Jonze's directing who gives us good information about the state of modern human relationships.
1;The biggest reason why I love this movie so much is not just because of the great plot but the fact that Joaquin Phoenix gave a masterful performance that was well worthy to win any best actor award. A truly must see film and by far the best film of 2013, Even beats a majority of the crap I've seen so far in 2014.
1;It's hard to express how much I love this film. Spike Jonze directs this film flawlessly with gorgeous shot after gorgeous shot. This is one of the most believable love story's I've ever seen and that credit goes to the phenomenal performance by Joaquin Phoenix and one of Scarlett Johansson's best performances even though it was only her voice. Her is breathtaking and my new favorite film of 2013.
1;Appropriate to think of it as a feature-length Twilight Zone episode. Funny, thoughtful, really well done. Fine acting all around... Phoenix in particular. Never really knew where the story was going, which was nice.
1;Awesome movie. It feels very original, and is written on a topic that isn't talked about much. The acting was amazing as well. It had to be, because most of the movie is dialogue and only one person is on screen. SJ did a fantastic job voicing the AI and really showed a ton of emotion with just her voice. You could feel what she was feeling.
1;Believe the hype. It's a visual masterpiece. Almost a single two hour action scene. There isn't a moment that goes by that the scenery isn't jaw dropping, the soundtrack stirring, and the action blistering. If you like your movies long and slowly building, maybe stay at home, this will probably give you a heart-attack.
1;Easily the best action movie of the last 20 odd years and the first franchise movie in recent memory that deserves getting a reboot. Fury Road features stunt work that makes all the superhero flicks look like Mattel commercials in comparison. The hype is real, guys.
1;As a huge fan of the previous films and having high expectations for Fury Road, I must say I was NOT disappointed. It's amazing and simply the best action film I've ever seen. When it really gets going, it's more frantic and pulse pounding than any video game I've ever played. Movie of the year so far.
1;George Miller has created a new language for action movies. The movie delivers the best breath-taking scenes. There is art in each take. The movie speaks by itself -- it is one of the rarest cases in which there is no need to explain about the movie.
1;One of the best action movies ever made in this century, From the beginning the action is instigating, soundtrack frantically frantic and although there is no script of a certain form it is there, Very good characters and spectacular action scenes, Photography is very good, assembly and mixing spectacular, Do not have to talk about this movie, simply the person have to watch to see how Mad Max is the best action movie ever made in these last times !!! 
1;Fury Road is one of the best if not the the best in the franchise. A masterpiece of gigantic proportions and a pedal to the metal furious experience. Groundbreaking and visually impressive.
1;A masterpiece of action, beautifuly produced. You can feel the passion that the director put on this work. It's a completely visual spectacle that you can watch again and again and again...
1;One of the Best action movie ever made. Well crafted screenplay and brilliant action choreography made this film a masterpiece
1;This is one of those films that just has everything, with a strong cast and premise its hard not to love what you're watching here.
1;The greatest movie of all time, amazing characters, great direction, breathtaking actions, gorgeous cinematography, spectacular score, and so much more, this is what a perfect movie looks like
0;Do not waste your time and money. Fake, fake, fake. A huge waste of many good actors' talent as well.
0;Confusing and disjointed. Can't hold a candle to the Winona Ryder version. The most interesting thing about the movie was the costumes. Acting was generally good, but Amy was just terrible!
0;Wow. What is happening to the movie critics these days? This was an awful film, and they didnt even notice. Is this what is taken for art these days? Firstly, the writing was incredibly poor and the dialogue stilted and unnatural, likely because it reflected the book too literally and was not adequately adapted to a movie screenplay. Secondly, the direction was very poor. There were major gaps in the plot making it seem incoherent at times. It left the viewer disoriented. Thirdly, the acting was only fair to midling. These are lightweight actors and they did nothing to anchor a poorly written screenplay. The only good parts were the costumes and cinematography. I love period piece dramas. But this was a waste of a couple of hours.
0;Over-the-top sappy, overwrought, and boring. I saw this with my girlfriend and her mom. The three of us have pretty different movie preferences, but an hour into this, we all looked at each other and decided to leave. Honestly perplexed why no other reviewers appear to feel this way.
0;Badly made, terrible acting and a real disappointment after Frances Ha. The whole thing was a clumsy retelling of the story with little inventiveness.
0;This movie was so boring all that happened was one sister died. Worst movie I’ve ever seen in my life.
0;This movie was honestly the stupidest movie I have ever seen in my entire life. Two hours that I never never get back in my life!
0;The movie is boring, very boring. It has a modicum of redeeming features but they are thoroughly smothered by the tedious boredom. My wife loved it so be warned that I may simply be a concrete emotionally shallow individual. The movie is a science fiction romantic drama set in a time where operating systems and artificial intelligence have developed so far that one can have a relationship with one's operating system. The movie explores the Utopian and dystopian consequences and compares and contrasts them with the current human status quo that we are all currently familiar with.
0;The stupidest movie I've ever seen, a perfect non sense with trendy lightning and clothes. A confusion chase the previous one in a world were technology is simply magic, avoiding every possible reflection about human perception of relationships. I've been waiting until the ending for any hints of thoughts about what defines a computer and what defines a human being, how they could eventually interact or look like each other. But noting happened there except teenage absurdity, let's see how this movie grows old in the next decades.
0;Ever seen a movie that's so bad when it pops back up in your memory you get angry? I saw this movie in theaters about a year ago, and something reminded me of it today, and I, instantly, got pissed off. This may very well be the worst movie I have ever seen, like, not even exaggerating, not even a little bit.
0;I loathed this movie. I do not fault the fine actors in this disaster, but this movie is proof that nothing can compensate for a stupid storyline. Sitting through this was absolute torture.
0;The most shallow, cringe-worthy film I've seen in a few years. Well, since Avatar. It is one of those embarrassingly thin visions of the future. It is also a philosophical disaster as the makers clearly haven't thought through the little vision which is the basis of the film--consciousness in computer form.
0;lame. i've tried watching this twice and got so bored i quit -- it seems absolutely pointless, no direction, characters are dimensionless and completely forgettable. I came here to see what others thought, and I cant believe the number of positive reviews. The scene where he has sex with the OS, and we stare of a blank screen - is rock bottom and makes me feel so angry that I even bothered to waste time on this film. Horrible
0;Hipster trash with an agenda to sell. Mind numbingly bad movie. This is some really bad joke maybe? I don't know, but Hollywood is on a lot of drugs and it shows.
0;I'm not sure what movie all of these critics saw but it most definitely was not the movie I endured. I found it to be boring, predictable, and horribly acted. I would have left if not for the fact that I was at a dine-in theater and had to wait on my food. One of the worst movies I have seen in a movie theater.
0;Very disappointing. Did I watch a completely different film than everyone else, or is the general movie going public just easily entertained by wrecks and explosions? Having waited for a year to see it, I hated it. The framing, color grading, practical effects, and stunt work were all astonishing. But, the acting (except for Hoult), characters, story, camera, matte work, compositing, were terrible.
0;I was really disappointed in Mad Max. The budget is certainly apparent on screen, which is pretty to look at, but it felt wasted against a bland story with no plot.
0;I can't remember the last time I was so disappointed in a move. I expected to love this movie - I love the originals specifically (first two more than the third, obviously) and sci-fi and post apocalyptic movies generally. I don't demand more than the skimpiest of plots in them as long as I care about whether the people live or die as we go on their journey with them. And in this movie I really didn't care.
0;There is no plot. There are no characters. There is no realism. There is, however, a great deal of random loud irritating nonsense happening incessantly. This film baffles, as a more or less identical film, minus perhaps some stylistic flair, could have been, and has been, directed by Michael Bay. Why anyone would like this or praise it in the way it has been, boggles the mind. It borders on unwatchable. Like the Dark Crystal, only instead of nothing happening and a bunch of deranged muppets limping about, here we have frenetic action courtesy decadent semi humans, where everything happens, but for no reason and to no point. This is the cure for insomnia.
0;I can't believe so many people liked this film, or perhaps I'm just missing the point. 90% of the film was a ridiculous car chase, and whilst I like a bit of action, most of this just seemed pointless. Where was everyone going? Why was there someone stuck to some rubber bands playing heavy metal music on a guitar? It was just ridiculous. The lack of story or character development made the film incredibly boring to watch. The classic Mad Max films were so much better than this drivel.
0;This movie is ridiculous. I have no idea why it's so highly rated by Tomatoes and why everyone seems to love it. It's a two-hour car chase. It's not even clever or well-done by action standards, it tries to be stylized but just ends up looking cheap, and not awesome. The effects are obvious and not well done. It was really, really dull.
0;If you just like seeing things explode in a desert themed car crash you may enjoy this rubbish film... The script may have been blown up in the opening credits as the actors seem to suffer from both terrible delivery and terrible content. I am blown away only by the positive reviews. Really there is little wonder TV series are becoming the go to for good content when the film industry is still trying to remake JAWS...
0;OMG, just sitting through the worst excuse for a movie in years. It is so bad that I was hoping it was nearly over and realised it was only halfway through. It's just regurgitation after regurgitation of the same thing every 20 minutes. Awful boring script, cliche after cliche, nothing original from first minute to last. Did they really just film over an hour or movie in exactly the same setting, a truck....I am so glad I did not waste my money in the cinema but feel ripped off paying for the rental.
0;This movie is laughable and an utter waste of your time. Anyone giving this a positive review is truly brain-dead. I now see how the same politicians keep getting re-elected. Save your time, this movie is an utter joke and turned a scary post-apocalyptic vision into an absurd circus. Mad Max(Tom Hardy) hardly seemed likeable or superhuman in most the movie maybe because he has almost no dialogue.
0;Horrible. Grating and annoying. Definitely not my cup of tea if you know what I mean. It was painful to sit through. Action with no substance. One of the worst of the year.
0;This movie was absolutely awful to watch. Two hours of boring plotless action, as most of the actions are chasing cars.
0;Absolutely the most stupid and boring and pointless movie I have ever seen. So glad I didn't pay money to see it. The professional critics have either lost their minds or are bought and paid for. PATHETIC!!!
0;This movie is the biggest waste of time and a disgrace to the original series. I can't understand how the rating of the majority of the "professionals" can give this movie 90+ ratings. This is a mindless cgi driven piece of crap with sub sub sub par acting and it completely misses an explanation for anything that occurs in the movie. And to top this off it last for 2 fricking hours!!!! There isn't even any character development at all! Garbage first class
0;I don't understand the appeal of this movie, had to turn it off after an hour. Realized pretty quickly that this movie's plot is bland and it's just simply a movie for 10-13 year old children who are so easily amused (not that I'd ever let my future kids watch this brain-cell destroying movie). If anyone says they like this movie, then I'm sorry but I ain't listening to any other movie critiques you have. There's no tension, over-dramatic characters that turn into white noise after a few minutes, and the slowest plot development I've ever seen in a movie, it takes more than half the movie to even know what the hell is going on and whose side you should even be on. I hate this movie with a passion but props to the low-standard individuals who found some enjoyment out of it.
0;Another boring movie, no interesting story, no interesting characters, main character just don't like to talk, typical action movie from 90's but with modern graphics and nostalgia effect for fans. Even Marvel 12+ movies are better. What a waste...
0;I only watched 30 minutes because it was just too dumb, exaggerated and poorly made for me, sorry. I can't understand the good reviews.
0;Wow I cannot believe the user score on this... maybe I missed something but the movie was boring. The special effects and action was great and who doesn't love a post apocalypse setting? But this movie suffers from very boring characters who were both uninteresting and poorly developed. I never cared for the Max himself, in fact, I rank the old movies as average or below, but the other characters were very 1 dimensional and I just didnt care what happens one way or another. The movie reminded me of Transformers, lots of pointless action and no heart (just replace cgi with live action). Overall, I would never watch this movie again so its slightly below average to me
0;The plot was stupid, none of the characters were memorable nor did I feel concern for any of them, the writing was strange and the entire film was dum, sexist and boring. The visuals and sound were fantastic though and Charlize Theron was not bad, aside from that it is a two hour car chase and after the first part of it the whole film was predictable.
0;One of the most overrated movies ever. On a technical level it is impressive, however, the story and characters are so thin. The action is great for about 10 minutes and then it becomes uninteresting. The movie had its moments, but in the end I can't possibly understand why everyone seems to love it.
0;Overlong, boring, and dull. Too much action and not enough of substance going on. It is impressive in its visuals and performances by its actors. But honestly boring, if you're new to the Mad max franchise, this movie is going to bore you, as I feel it did with me.
1;Mad Max Fury Road is an awesome post apocalyptic movie. At first I was doubtful if I should watch it or not. If I didn't watch it I would missed something extraordinary.
1;An incredible, relentless, adrenaline fueled action thrill ride that's an absolute blast to watch. Hardy, Theron and Hoult are all great also. Definitely one of the best action movies of the decade so far.
1;I'm going to be honest: this is the only Mad Max movie I've seen, and I know almost nothing about the other ones. The fact that I still love this movie is a good indication that it can stand on it's own. The story and characters are simple, but effective, and I can still get a good idea of what's going on despite not much being explained. The movie is also basically a 2-hour car chase with some of the best action in any movie ever. That alone is enough to make me love it.
1;Mad Max is back and better than ever. I really enjoy this movie for what it is. it had me at the edge of my seat. It had great action, great characters, and great locations and an awesome villain. This movie is good for anyone who wants to see a good action movie.
1;Absolutely incredible. I found it difficult to blink in this movie because I didn't want to miss the action. Possibly the best action movie ever and I realize that is a bold statement, but still. I love this movie and can't wait to get it on Blu-ray.
